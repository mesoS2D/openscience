Wuhu,

I am sending you the ASCII file of the SOR horizontal wind data. For each
group, the data has 51 rows, corresponding to altitudes from 80 to 105 km
(from top to bottom), at 0.5 km interval.  The 12 columns correspond to the
12 months.

This data is obtained by fitting the mean, 12-month and 6-month harmonics on
the original monthly mean wind data, which are available in 11 months out of
12, with no data in July.

I can send you the original monthly mean data as well if you want.  But I
think this fitted dataset is better for this comparison.

Let me know if you have any questions.



Alan
