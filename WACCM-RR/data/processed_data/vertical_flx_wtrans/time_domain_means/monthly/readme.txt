Monthly means of variables.

Example filenames:
on_lev_nonrr_cm_mean_T_NO_O_CO2_CO_H2O_fullcol_2010-06.nc
on_lev_rr_cm_mean_z_T_NO_O_CO2_CO_H2O_fullcol_2010-06.nc
{on_lev}_{RR/Non-RR}_{region}_mean_{variables}_{fullcol if it contains all levels from top of atmosphere to surface}_{yyyy-mm}.nc

Files with variable list beginning "z" are generated from corresponding monthly mean files (without z) and are required for interpolation of fluxes and transport velocities to altitude.
